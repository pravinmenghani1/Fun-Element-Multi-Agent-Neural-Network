   - **Why brilliant:** Detects head & shoulders, triangles, flags like a master trader
   - **Visual:** Watch filters detect chart patterns automatically

4. **🔄 Transformer (Attention Mechanism)**
   - **What it does:** Pays attention to multiple market factors simultaneously
   - **Why revolutionary:** Processes all timeframes in parallel with attention weights
   - **Visual:** See attention heatmaps showing what the AI focuses on

5. **🎭 GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**
   - **What it does:** Generates realistic market scenarios for testing
   - **Why mind-blowing:** Creates fake market data indistinguishable from real
   - **Visual:** Watch generator vs discriminator battle to create perfect simulations

6. **🧠 Ensemble Learning**
   - **What it does:** Combines all networks for ultimate prediction power
   - **Why superior:** Always better than any individual network
   - **Visual:** See how different predictions combine into final decision
