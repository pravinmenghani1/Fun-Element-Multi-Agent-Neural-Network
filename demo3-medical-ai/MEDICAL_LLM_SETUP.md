# üè• Medical LLM Integration Setup Guide

## Quick Start (Recommended)

### Option 1: Local Medical LLM with Ollama (FREE)
```bash
# Ollama should already be installed from Demo 2
# If not: brew install ollama

# Start Ollama service
brew services start ollama

# The system will automatically use available models:
# - llama3.2:latest (preferred)
# - mistral:latest (fallback)
```

### Option 2: Fallback Mode (No Setup Required)
The system automatically provides medical explanations using rule-based responses if LLM is unavailable.
