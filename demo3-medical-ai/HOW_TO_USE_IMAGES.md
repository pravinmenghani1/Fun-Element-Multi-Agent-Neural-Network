## üéØ **Demo Script for Educators:**

### **Introduction:**
"Today we'll see how AI can analyze medical images just like a radiologist. We have 4 different types of medical images to test our CNN AI doctor."

### **For Each Image:**
1. **Show the image:** "This is a [chest X-ray/skin lesion/brain MRI/hand X-ray]"
2. **Enter symptoms:** "Let's enter symptoms that match this image"
3. **Upload image:** "Now we upload the medical image for AI analysis"
4. **Select CNN:** "We'll use our CNN AI doctor - the visual expert"
5. **Explain results:** "Watch how the AI analyzes visual patterns and features"

### **Key Teaching Points:**
- **CNN Specialization:** "CNNs are perfect for image analysis"
- **Medical Applications:** "This is how AI assists doctors today"
- **Pattern Recognition:** "AI can spot patterns humans might miss"
- **Limitations:** "This is educational only - real diagnosis needs doctors"
